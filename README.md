## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate how healthcare analytics teams transform raw patient data into actionable clinical insights using SQL and BI tools.

---

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL – Data storage & SQL analytics
- Power BI – Dashboard & visualization
- CSV Healthcare Dataset – Raw patient data
